<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>Among all the applications of electricity to
domestic or commercial uses, few are as widespread
as the electric bell. Practically every building
used for a dwelling, storage or manufacture
requires an electric bell, annunciator or alarm
system.</p>

<p>This book was written to explain in practical
language how an electric bell system operates and
how it is installed; its success shown by its large
sale has resulted in this new edition which brings
the subject up to date.</p>

<p>Many new diagrams of annunciator and burglar
alarm systems have been added, together with descriptions
and illustrations of wiring elevators for
electric bells, wiring for door openers, the use of
transformers for furnishing suitable ringing current
from electric light circuits; and high voltage
bells intended to be used on other than the customary
low voltage battery circuits.</p>

<p>The author expresses his acknowledgment to the
Western Electric Company for diagrams of door
opener circuits in connection with their interphone
systems, to Edwards and Company of New York
for diagrams of fire alarms, burglar alarms and
annunciators, and to the Westinghouse Company
for illustrations of bell-ringing transformers.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>An electric bell depends for its action on the
fact that a piece of iron wound with insulated
wire becomes a magnet and will attract another
piece of iron just so long as an electric current is
allowed to travel through the wire.</p>

<p>The instant the current ceases, the magnetism
also ceases, and the attracted piece of iron (termed
the armature) is no longer held in contact.</p>

<p>The general construction of an electric bell
is shown in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>. <i>M M</i> are coils of insulated
wire wound on soft iron cores. <i>A</i> is a soft iron
armature mounted on a flat spring so that it is
normally kept a slight distance away from the
soft iron cores. <i>S</i> is a brass screw with a platinum
tip touching a platinum disc on a spring
attached to the armature.</p>

<p>When the push button <i>P</i> is pressed down, its
two brass springs touch each other, the current
from the battery cell <i>B</i> then flows through the
wire <i>W</i>, through the push <i>P</i>, through the
coils <i>M M</i>, along <i>A</i> to the platinum disc, out
at <i>S</i>, which touches this disc, and back to the
battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<div id="if_i_000" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.6875em;">
  <img id="Fig_1" src="images/i_000.jpg" width="603" height="303" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
The instant this is done the current causes the
iron cores to become magnets, they attract <i>A</i>,
which then breaks contact at <i>S</i>. The spring
mounting of <i>A</i> causes it to jump back to its
first position, <i>S</i> then touches the platinum disc
again, the current flows as before, and the armature
is again attracted only to break contact
with <i>S</i> and fly back.</p>

<p>This continual making and breaking of the
circuit keeps up as long as the push is pressed, a
ball mounted on <i>A</i> by means of a rod strikes
against the gong <i>G</i> causing a continuous ringing
of the bell. The wires leading between the bell,
battery cell and push must all be insulated, that
is, covered with cotton, rubber, etc., which prevents
the leakage of current should two wires
cross each other. Copper wire is mostly used for
circuits indoors, the details of the kind and size
of wire will be given later on.</p>

<p>The main parts of an electric bell circuit are
then—the battery to supply the electric current;
the circuit, or wires, to carry this current; a push,
or circuit breaker, to control the current flow;
and a bell to utilize the current.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>The Battery</i></span></h2>
</div>

<h3>The Battery Cell.</h3><p>The battery cell most used
in electric bell work is the Leclanche, or some
modification of it.</p>

<div id="ip_1" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20.9375em;">
  <img id="Fig_2" src="images/i_001.jpg" width="335" height="275" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span></div></div>

<p>The Leclanche battery cell is shown in <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>,
where <i>J</i> is a glass jar, <i>Z</i> a rod of zinc, and <i>P</i> a jar
of porous earthenware containing a carbon rod
surrounded by powdered carbon and peroxide of
manganese.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
In setting up this cell about four ounces of
sal ammoniac (chloride of ammonia) are put into
the jar and enough water added to come about
half way up the jar.</p>

<p>The porous jar <i>P</i> and the zinc <i>Z</i> are then
inserted, and the cell is ready for use in a few
minutes after the liquid has soaked through the
earthenware into the carbon-manganese mixture.
Water is often poured into the porous jar through
holes in its top to hasten this wetting.</p>

<p>Wires are clamped by nuts or set-screws to the
negative terminal on the zinc or the positive terminal
on the carbon, it generally not being of
consequence which terminal is attached to either
wire of the circuit.</p>

<p>A battery cell could be constructed without the
manganese, using simply a plate of carbon and
a rod of zinc, but hydrogen gas would be generated
on the carbon plate when the cell was working
and would stop the current flowing.</p>

<p>This is called polarization, and peroxide of manganese
is a de-polarizer, because it combines with
this hydrogen gas almost as fast as it is generated,
and prevents, to a great extent, the polarization.</p>

<p>But it does not stop it entirely, as will be seen
if the Leclanche cell is kept working above its
capacity. Then the hydrogen is generated too
fast for the manganese to destroy it, and the cell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
ceases to work. In this case a rest will often
restore the cell to its former power.</p>

<p>Cells which have been almost unable to make
a bell give even a single tap have been found
good again when allowed to remain at rest over
night.</p>

<p>In setting up a battery cell no liquid should be
splashed on the brass terminals or corrosion will
take place. Every metal surface where connection
is made to allow electric current to pass <em>must</em>
be clean and bright, and all screws, or nuts, holding
wires must be screwed up tight so that the
wires are firmly clamped.</p>

<p>Loose or dirty connections are the cause of
probably eight out of every ten troubles affecting
bells and batteries.</p>

<p>When the fluid in a Leclanche cell becomes
milky, more sal ammoniac must be added. Or,
better still, throw out the old solution, wash the
porous jar thoroughly in clean water, scrape the
zinc bright, and half fill the cell with fresh solution.</p>

<p>The zinc wearing away rapidly or becoming
covered with crystals, and a strong smell of ammonia,
show generally that the cell is being worked
too hard, or that the current is leaking where it
should not.</p>

<p>A zinc rod in a cell working the average door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
bell should last for six months, the porous jar for
a year.<br /></p>

<h3>The Dry Cell.</h3><p>The Leclanche cell being a
cell with much free liquid is liable to dry up if
not watched. The dry cell (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>) is a modern
form of the Leclanche where the liquid is held by
an absorbent material, such as blotting paper, or
plaster.</p>

<div id="ip_4" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 8.4375em;">
  <img id="Fig_3" src="images/i_004.jpg" width="135" height="323" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span></div></div>

<p>A typical dry cell<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>is shown in the figure. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
outside case of zinc is lined with blotting paper
dampened with chloride of zinc and sal ammoniac.
A carbon rod is then inserted in the centre and
packed around with carbon dust and peroxide of
manganese. The latter mixture is also somewhat
dampened.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> For full description of this class of battery see No. 3
Book on “Dry Batteries.”</p></div>

<p>Molten wax, or a suitable composition, is then
poured on top of the contents of the cell to seal it
up and prevent the evaporation of the fluid. A
terminal on the carbon rod and another on the
zinc case complete the cell.</p>

<div id="ip_5" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.0625em;">
  <img id="Fig_4" src="images/i_005.jpg" width="353" height="148" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span></div></div>

<p>The voltage of both the Leclanche and the dry
cell is about 1.45, when it goes below this it indicates
that the cell is worked out.</p>

<p>The two cells described are known as open-circuit
cells and are only intended for intermittent
working.</p>

<p>When a current is needed for a long period at
a time a closed circuit cell should be used, such as
the gravity Daniell cell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<h3>The Gravity Daniell Cell.</h3><p>The gravity cell,
<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, has a zinc block <i>Z</i> suspended from the
side of the jar and a number of copper leaves <i>C</i>
standing on edge at the bottom. A quantity of
bluestone (sulphate of copper) is poured over the
copper leaves and the jar filled with water.</p>

<p>During the working of this cell, copper is deposited
on the copper plate, and sulphate of zinc
formed at the zinc. To hasten the action a small
quantity of zinc sulphate can be added to the
solution when setting up the cell.</p>

<p>The name of this cell comes from the fact that
the copper solution being heavier remains at the
bottom of the jar. If the cell is not worked
enough, all the solution will become blue and the
zinc will blacken. If very dirty from this cause,
remove the zinc, scrape and wash it thoroughly.
Throw out all the solution, add new sulphate and
water and replacing the zinc, then put the cell
on short circuit by connecting the copper and
zinc together for a few hours.<br /></p>

<h3>E. M. F.</h3><p>The e. m. f. of a gravity cell is within
a fraction of one volt, its current nearly one-half
ampere.</p>

<p>Warmth makes it give a greater current; on
no account let a gravity cell freeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<h3>Resistance of a Cell.</h3><p>The fluids in a cell do
not conduct electricity as well as copper does; they
offer more resistance and thus reduce the current
output.</p>

<p>The internal resistance of a cell may be lowered
by using large zinc plates curled around the
porous pot.</p>

<p>The Samson cell has a large zinc plate bent in
the form of a cylinder, the carbon-manganese
combination standing in the centre of it.</p>

<p>The dry cell also has a large zinc, the internal
resistance being thus much lowered, the current
output is increased. This is by reason of Ohm’s
law, which teaches that to increase the current
flow, either the voltage of the battery must be increased,
or the resistance decreased.</p>

<p>But increased current means lessened life; there
is only just so much energy in a cell mainly dependent
on the quantity of chemicals.<br /></p>

<h3>Grouping of Cells.</h3><p>Cells may be grouped in a
battery to get increased voltage, or increased amperage.
When connected for the former, they
are in series, the carbon of one is connected to the
zinc of the next, and so on.</p>

<p>If all the carbons are connected together and all
the zincs, they are in multiple, and will give the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
same voltage as of one cell but the combined amperage
of all.</p>

<p>In ordinary bell work the series is the general
connection, the higher the resistance of the circuit,
or the longer the wires, the more voltage is
required.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>Bells and Pushes</i></span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Electric Bells.</h3><p>The two main types of house
bells are the iron box and the skeleton.</p>

<p>The iron box has a cast-iron frame, or base, and
a cast- or stamped-iron cover over the mechanism.</p>

<p>The skeleton bell has an iron frame but no
cover, and is generally better finished and more
expensive than the iron box bells.</p>

<p>For fire alarm purposes, mechanical bells or
gongs are made, in which a clockwork mechanism
causes the hammer to strike the gong upon
being released by electromagnetism.</p>

<p>Marine or waterproof bells have an iron cover
fitting tight over a rubber gasket; they are for
marine, or mining, work.</p>

<p>Polarized, or magneto, bells are used in telephone
work, and are rarely operated by a battery,
but have a miniature dynamo generator operated
by hand, or power, to supply the actuating current.</p>

<p>Most bells are classed for size by the diameter
of the gong, a four-inch bell being one with a
gong four inches in diameter; a six-inch bell one
with a six-inch gong, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
According to the use for which they are intended,
bells may be vibrating, as before described,
single-stroke, shunt or short-circuiting, differential,
continuous-ringing, or adapted for circuits of
high voltage.<br /></p>

<h3>The Single-stroke Bell.</h3><p>The bell before described,
and again shown in <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>, is a vibrating,
or trembling, bell. It is often desired to have the
hammer give only one stroke for each pressure of
the push, as in signaling with a code of taps; in
this case a single-stroke bell is used. The circuit
from the binding posts is then directly through
the magnet coils without any break at the contact
screw, as in <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<div id="ip_10" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.6875em;">
  <img id="Fig_5" src="images/i_010.jpg" width="395" height="79" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="floatl"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span></span>

<span class="floatc"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span></span>

<span class="floatr"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7</span></span></div></div>

<p>In adjusting such a bell to give a clear sound,
press the armature up against the iron magnet
cores and then bend back the hammer until it just
clears the gong. The spring of the hammer wire
will carry the hammer sufficiently forward to hit
the gong. The tone will be clearer than if the
hammer dampered the gong by pressing against
it when the armature was nearest the core.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
By bringing out a third connection, a vibrating
bell may be made both single stroke and vibrating.<br /></p>

<h3>The Shunt Bell.</h3><p>There is a form of bell,
<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 7</a>, known as the shunt, or short circuit bell,
which is often used when two or more are to be
connected in series, as will be seen in the description
of circuits. In this bell the circuit through
the magnets is not broken at the contact screw,
but the forward movement of the armature short
circuits the coils.</p>

<p>As the short, or shunt, circuit is very much
lower in resistance than the wire on the magnet
coils, the main current flows around the latter and
they do not become energized. The sparking at
the shunting contact screw is much less than it
would be at the ordinary breaking contact screw,
and the platinum points last longer.<br /></p>

<h3>The Differential Bell.</h3><p>Sparking at the breaking
contacts of an electric bell is detrimental to
the platinum points, and many remedies have been
devised to overcome it.</p>

<p>Sparking is due to the self-induction of one
turn of the wire coil acting on its neighbor, and
this property is utilized in the gas engine, or gas-lighting
spark coil, where a fat spark is needed to
ignite gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
The differential bell has two windings in opposite
directions. The action of one would be to
produce an N-pole at one end and an S-pole at
the other. But the second coil produces poles just
the opposite, as the polarity of a magnet depends
on the direction in which the current flows around
it.</p>

<p>Where the current flows around the first winding
the armature is attracted and its spring contact
meets the contact screw and allows the current
to divide, part flowing through the first coil,
the other flowing in the reverse direction in the
opposite way. One coil would tend to produce
an N-pole where the other coil produced an S-pole,
and these opposite poles would so neutralize each
other that there would be no magnetism.</p>

<p>The armature would therefore be pulled back
by its spring when both coils were thrown into
circuit. In so doing it would cut out one coil
and the same series of operations would recommence.</p>

<p>As a spark is normally produced where magnetism
is <em>lost</em> by a break of circuit,<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> no spark appears,
as magnetism is <em>produced</em> by a break of
circuit in this case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> For a full explanation of self-induction see No. 1 of
this series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p></div>

<h3>Continuous-ring Bell.</h3><p>In some classes of bell
work, such as burglar alarms, it is desired that the
bell when once started shall continue to ring until
stopped by the person called. In this case a continuous-ringing
bell is needed, such as in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<div id="ip_13" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.25em;">
  <img id="Fig_8" src="images/i_013.jpg" width="388" height="304" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8</span></div></div>

<p>When the push <i>P</i> is pressed, the current flows
in the usual way through contact screw <i>L</i>, armature
spring <i>A</i>, magnet coils <i>M M</i>, battery <i>B</i>, back
to <i>P</i>, and the bell rings. But on the first forward
movement of the armature it releases the spring
contact <i>S</i>, which flies forward and makes contact
at <i>U</i>. The circuit is now from <i>B</i>, through <i>M M</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
to <i>A</i>, thence through <i>L</i> and <i>S</i>, to <i>U</i> and back
to <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>The bell will continue to ring until the spring
contact <i>S</i> is moved back and caught by the projection
on the armature <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>A continuous-ring attachment is also made and
sold in most electrical supply stores, which is complete
in itself and can be applied to any bell.</p>

<div id="ip_14" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20.5em;">
  <img id="Fig_9" src="images/i_014.jpg" width="328" height="206" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9</span></div></div>

<h3>Waterproof Bells.</h3><p>In <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a> is an example of
a waterproof bell where the mechanism is almost
all entirely encased in a waterproof brass case.</p>

<p>The circuit is made and broken inside the case,
but the magnet cores project through it and act
on a second armature placed outside. This second
armature carries the hammer which strikes
the gong and is governed in speed by the contact-breaking
armature inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<h3>Forms of Bell Gongs.</h3><p>In order to provide a
variety of sounds, bells are provided with gongs
of various shapes.</p>

<p>A coil of steel wire is also used, as in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>,
which on being struck by the hammer gives a
pleasant but not loud tone.</p>

<h3>The Buzzer.</h3><p>The buzzer is the mechanism of
a vibrating bell less the hammer and gong. As
the armature vibrates it makes a buzzing noise
which does not carry as far as the sound from
a struck gong. It is used chiefly for a desk call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
and in telephone exchange work, or any place
where general attention is not desired to the signal.<br /></p>

<h3>Operating Bells at a Distance.</h3><p>When it is
desired to ring a bell situated at a considerable
distance from the push, the resistance of the line
becomes objectionable.</p>

<div id="ip_16" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.25em;">
  <img id="Fig_15" src="images/i_016.jpg" width="388" height="260" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15</span></div></div>

<p>On lines of 500 feet, No. 18 copper wire and
upwards, the battery necessary would be very
large, two small batteries and a relay would prove
more satisfactory.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a> the circuit of a simple form of relay
is given. An adjustable contact screw <i>C</i> is placed
where an extension <i>S</i> of the armature <i>A</i> can strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
it. This extension is provided with a platinum
contact. The connections are as in the figure.</p>

<p>When the push <i>P</i> is depressed, the current from
the main battery <i>M</i> energizes the electromagnet <i>E</i>,
and the armature <i>A</i> being attracted, contacts <i>S</i>
and <i>C</i> meet. These contacts close the second circuit
containing the bell <i>B</i> and the local battery <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>The relay resembles a second push near the
bell, but controlled by current from a distance
instead of being depressed by hand. Its advantage
consists in it needing but a very weak current
to move the armature <i>A</i>, which is held back
by a light spring, or by gravity.</p>

<p>The relay may then be set near the bell and
the wires from the push may be of a very great
length. Battery <i>L</i>, which actually rings the bell,
will thus only have to work through a few feet
of wire.<br /></p>

<h3>Reducing Resistance of a Bell.</h3><p> Sometimes
it is desired to reduce the resistance the bell coils
offer to the current, the bell then working over a
very short line with few cells of battery. Or
the bell coils may have been wound with fine
wire for large battery voltage and a long line.</p>

<p>The bell coils may be put in multiple, the current
then dividing and one-half going through
each spool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Untwist the joint between the spools near the
yoke or iron bar to which the spools are attached.
Join one of these ends to the wire at the armature
end of the <em>other</em> spool and the second untwisted
end to the armature end wire of its neighboring
spool. Use short pieces of insulated wire for
these extra connections.</p>

<p>The current now instead of having to go
through one spool and then the other, can branch
through both at once.</p>

<p>The resistance to the current of one spool is
half the resistance of two, the current through one
spool will therefore be twice that through the
two spools as at first connected. And as there are
two paths for it, each one-half the first resistance,
the total will be only one-fourth the resistance
of the ordinary series arrangement.</p>

<p>The same size battery will therefore send four
times the current through the spools in multiple
than when they are in series.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the wire on one spool is
wound in the reverse direction to that on the
other. The reason will be apparent if the two
spools and yoke are considered as merely one
spool bent in a U or horseshoe form.</p>

<p>If both spools were wound in the same direction
they would be in opposite directions when the
U were straightened out, and would cause like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
poles at the same ends. These poles would neutralize
one another, so that there would be no
magnetic attraction.</p>

<p>This can be readily proved by joining together
the two yoke ends and the two armature ends of
the spool wires. Then pass the current through
these two joined connections.</p>

<h3>The Push Button.</h3><p> Push buttons, or pushes,
are made in a variety of forms, with metal, wood,
hard rubber, or porcelain bases.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a> has a metal base, and is suitable for
a front door.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 17</a> is a wooden pear push, and is attached at
the end of a cord which has the two conductors
braided in it, each, however, having its own insulation.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 18</a> is a plate push for an outside door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 19</a> is either of metal, wood, or porcelain,
and is the shape most commonly used.</p>

<p>A three-point push has three contact springs.
One is movable by means of the button, one is
below the movable spring, and the third is above
it.</p>

<div id="ip_20" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.5em;">
  <img id="Fig_20" src="images/i_020.jpg" width="376" height="202" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20</span></div></div>

<p>When the push button is not being depressed,
the movable spring makes contact with the upper
spring. But when the button is depressed, these
two springs part, and the movable spring makes
contact with the lower one.</p>

<p>This style of push is used for special bell and
annunciator work, as will be described later.</p>

<p>The form of combination floor and table push in
<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a> is the most solidly constructed device of
its kind. The lower part is set in a hole bored
in the flooring, the metal flange keeping it in
place and preventing its slipping through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
The floor push attachment works as follows:
The central metal rod is divided into two parts
<i>B D</i>, by an insulating piece of hard rubber. When
depressed against the action of the spiral spring
by the foot, the upper part <i>B</i> connects together the
contact springs <i>A C</i>, closing the circuit of bell
and battery. These contact springs are insulated
from each other by a hard rubber block <i>R</i>.</p>

<p>From the table push a cord containing two insulated
wires leads to the two parts of the rod
at <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>. When the push centre is pressed
down, the push springs come together and practically
short circuit <i>B</i> and <i>D</i>, which completes the
circuit of bell and battery. At any time the centre
rod may be removed, leaving a surface almost
flush with the carpet, or floor, over which furniture
may be moved without injury to the mechanism
of the push.</p>

<p>For a floor push alone a shorter form of the
centre rod is also sometimes furnished which is
not divided by insulation. The spiral spring
keeps it clear of the lower contact <i>A</i> but enables
it to always make connection with the upper contact
<i>B</i>. Pressing this rod down will also short
circuit the bell and battery so that the signal is
given.</p>

<p>A door pull attachment, like <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, is made
so that the ordinary form of lever pull bell may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
be changed into an electric bell. Being screwed
up near the door pull, a wire is run from the latter
and fastened to lever <i>L</i>. When the pull is
drawn out the lever <i>L</i> turns on a pivot and a
projection presses the insulated spring <i>S</i> against
the metal base <i>B</i>. The circuit of the bell and
battery being thus closed, the bell rings.</p>

<h3>Indicating Push Button.</h3><p> A push button is
made which contains in the base a small electromagnet
in series with the line. An armature on
a spring is fixed near the magnet poles. When
the push is depressed, the current travels through
this electromagnet, and as the circuit is made
and broken at the distant bell, it is also interrupted
in the electromagnet. The armature vibrates in
unison with the bell and thus gives an audible
indication that the bell is ringing.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>Wiring, Circuits and Troubles</i></span></h2>
</div>

<h3>The Wire.</h3><p> The size of the copper wire used
in bell work is No. 16, or No. 18, B and S gauge,
and sometimes smaller, such as No. 20 to 22.
But smaller wire than No. 18 has too much resistance,
and would necessitate a larger battery
power, even if its mechanical strength were not
too low. The insulating coverings are cotton saturated
with paraffin wax or compounds.</p>

<p>The covered wires are variously known as annunciator,
office, or weatherproof wire, these terms
being mostly for distinction of the coverings and
not for the use to which the wire would be put.</p>

<p>Annunciator wire has two layers of cotton
merely wrapped around the copper and then saturated
with paraffin.</p>

<p>Office wire has the two cotton layers braided,
the inside one being filled with a moisture-repelling
compound.</p>

<p>Both office and annunciator wires have their
outside coverings filled with paraffin and highly
polished.</p>

<p>From the ease with which annunciator wire is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
stripped of its cotton covering, the braided office
wire is to be preferred. These coverings are made
in a variety of colors.</p>

<p>Weatherproof covered wire is mostly used for
electric light work, but the sizes given above are
good for bell work, although their larger outside
diameter makes them harder to conceal.</p>

<p>The approximate number of feet to the pound
of office and annunciator wire is given in the
table.</p>

<h3>Joints.</h3><p> Upon the care with which a joint is
made much depends, a loose or poorly made joint
will offer much resistance to the current.</p>

<p>The correct way to start a joint in annunciator,
or office, wire is shown in <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>. About three
inches of each wire to be joined is bared of its
insulation and scraped bright. The ends are then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
bent at right angles to each other, hooked together
and one end firmly twisted around the other, as
shown in <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>. Any projecting pieces are cut
off, and the joints should then be <em>soldered</em> to prevent
corrosion.</p>

  <img id="Fig_22" src="images/i_025.jpg" width="336" height="89" alt="" />

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 24</span></p></div></div>

<p>Adhesive tape (“friction tape”) is wrapped
around the joint, <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>, and pressed firmly together
so that there is no chance of its unravelling.
The tape wrapping should extend across the joint
and on to about a half inch of the insulation
around each wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<h3>Running the Wires.</h3><p> To detail all the operations
of installing a complex system of bell, alarm
and annunciator wires would be impossible from
the reasons that conditions vary and space is limited.
General directions will then only be given
to enable the inexperienced to run such wires as
may be needed in ordinary domestic work and to
guard against the most common causes of failure.</p>

<p>Wires may be run in tin tubes to prevent the
depredations of rats and mice, or they may be run
with simply their own covering for protection; it
is presumed the latter is undertaken.</p>

<p>In a case where the building is of frame and
in course of erection the task is much simplified.</p>

<p>Having first decided upon the plan, number of
bells, pushes, etc. and their location, proceed to
run the wires first in order that the pushes, bells,
etc. may not be injured.</p>

<p>But where the house is already occupied, as in
the majority of cases likely to be met with by the
reader, the bell and battery may be set first.</p>

<p>Take the case of an ordinary door bell with the
push at the front door, the bell in the kitchen and
the battery in the cellar. If possible get the wire
on two spools; it will simplify matters if both
wires are of different colors. Starting at the push,
have a foot of each wire for connection and slack,
and fasten each wire lightly to the woodwork with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
staples, or double-pointed tacks, never putting two
wires under one staple nor driving in a staple so
it cuts the insulation. Some cases will require a
staple about every foot, on straight runs sometimes
every three feet.</p>

<p>In many cases the wires can be partly concealed
in the angle between a moulding and the
wall, or even in a groove of the moulding itself.
When running along a skirting, the wires may
often be pushed out of sight between it and the
floor. Do not attempt to draw the wires too
tight or the changes of the weather may break the
wires when the woodwork shrinks or swells.</p>

<p>The wires will be, one from the push to the
bell, one from the push to the battery, and one
from the bell to the battery. So it is probable
that the second wire can be run right through a
small hole bored in the flooring under the push,
but inside the front door. In this case it will
be perhaps easier if the spool be left in the cellar
and the end of the wire be pushed up from below
and stapled to the woodwork near the push, leaving
the cellar work to the last. Only one wire
will be run then direct to the bell upstairs and
it can be better concealed than two.</p>

<p>If necessary it may be drawn under a carpet
and not stapled, or it can often be forced into the
crack between two boards. But if not, run it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
along the skirting, following the walls until it
reaches below the bell. It is often better to go
entirely around a room than to cross below a
door.</p>

<p>If a door must be crossed the wire may either
run up one side of the frame and down the other
or laid beneath the carpet on the sill. The former
is preferable, but takes more wire.</p>

<p>In many houses the bell wire as well as the battery
wire may be run across the cellar beams
(<a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>), in which case bore a second hole for it
near the push; do not draw it through the same
hole as the push to battery wire. And, of course,
here work upwards with the spool in the cellar.</p>

<p>Having reached the bell location, run the third
wire down into the cellar to the battery. Now
connect up the push, baring an inch or so of each
wire, push them through the holes provided in
the push base, screw down the push base and
clamp the wires under the washers through which
the connection screws run. Do this neatly, be sure
the ends of the wires do not stick out, cut off
what is left free of the bared ends. Then connect
the battery to the wire from the push and the
wire from the bell. The last thing is to scrape
and fasten the bell wires to the bell binding posts.
Do this so that they cannot come loose and that
they make good contact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<div id="ip_29" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
The bell should now ring properly when the
push is pressed.</p>

<p>To sum up, one wire leads from one spring
of the push to the bell, one wire from the other
spring of the push to the battery, and another wire
from the remaining binding post on the bell to the
remaining binding post on the battery. It is immaterial
whether the zinc terminal or the carbon
terminal go to the bell or push.<br /></p>

<h3>Combinations of Bells and Pushes.</h3><p> One of
the wires in a bell circuit may be replaced by
the ground (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>). Connection may be made
to a gas or water pipe or to a metal plate buried
deep in damp earth. Any wire fastened to such a
plate must be thoroughly soldered to it or a voltaic
action will be set up, which will eat it away at the
point of contact.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26</span></div></div>

<p>When one bell is to be rung from two or
more points the pushes are to be connected in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
multiple (<a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>) as if they were in series; all
would have to be closed to complete the circuit.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28</span></div></div>

<p>If two bells are to be operated from one push
they may be in series (<a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>), but in this case
one of them must be arranged for single stroke.
If both were vibrating bells the armature of one
would not vibrate in unison with the other armature
and the result would be irregular contact
breaking and intermittent ringing.</p>

<div id="ip_31c" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.4375em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29</span></div></div>

<p>A preferable connection for two or more bells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and one push is <a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>, where the bells are in
multiple. This requires more current than the
series method.</p>

<div id="ip_32" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">

<p>To ring two bells from either one of two points,
the arrangement in <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a> will answer. It requires
only two wires or one wire and ground
return, but two batteries. As both bells are in
multiple both will ring, the one nearest the push
being depressed ringing the loudest. This is a disadvantage.
If the series arrangement in <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
be selected, one bell must be arranged for single
stroke. Both bells will ring with equal power.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a> only the distant bell rings, the circuit

two wires and ground return.</p>

<p>A plan where two batteries are needed but only
two wires, or one wire and ground is in <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>.
Double contact or three-point pushes are necessary
here, making one contact when depressed and a
second one when not being touched.</p>

<h3>Faults in Bells.</h3><p> On examining many electric
bells it will be noted that only one binding post
is insulated from the frame when the latter is
of iron (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>). As the armature spring <i>S</i> is in
electrical connection with the frame <i>F</i> by reason
of its metal screws and support, the circuit may
run from the insulated post <i>U</i> to the magnet coils,
thence through the insulated contact screw <i>C</i>
through the armature spring (when it is making
contact) and through the frame to the uninsulated
post <i>I</i>.</p>

<p>This saves labor, wire and complication, but if
the insulation of the post <i>U</i>, the wires <i>W V</i>, or the
contact screw <i>C</i> be injured, the current may take
a short path back to the frame.</p>

<p>If <i>C</i> were thus grounded, the bell would act as
a single-stroke bell.</p>

<p>If <i>U</i> were grounded, the bell would not ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
at all, as that would be a short circuit on the battery
between <i>I</i> and <i>U</i> and the latter would also
result if the bare wire were touching the frame
at <i>V</i>.</p>

<p>If the bare wire touched the frame beyond <i>M M</i>,
that is, along <i>W</i>, it would be a single-stroke bell,
as if <i>C</i> were grounded.</p>

<p>As any one of these faults is likely to occur,
they should be looked for when the bell acts imperfectly,
or not at all.</p>

<p>A very common fault in a bell is when its armature
sticks to the cores and thus does not make
contact with the contact screw. This may be from
a weak spring or because of the loss of the pieces
of brass inserted in the ends of the cores to keep
the armature away from actual contact. A piece
of a postage stamp stuck over the core end will
often help out in the latter case.</p>

<p>A high screeching noise from the armature vibrating
too rapidly but with too little play, may
be from excessive battery power or the contact
screw being too far forward. The former will
generally be detected by the violent sparking as
well as the rapid vibration.</p>

<p>In very cheap bells the platinum contacts may
be replaced by German silver or some other metal.</p>

<p>Platinum is necessary because the sparking
would soon corrode other metals, but it is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
expensive. To test for platinum put a tiny drop
of nitric acid on the suspected metal. If bubbles
or smoke appear it is not platinum. After applying
this test in any case however, carefully wash
off and remove all traces of the acid, as it will corrode
the metal into which the platinum is riveted.</p>

<p>Dirty contacts will decrease the current in the
bell coils and it will not work well, if at all.</p>

<p>Loose contact screws and wires also give
trouble. The adjusting of the contact screw is of
the utmost importance, and should never be attempted
unless it is clearly necessary.<br /></p>

<h3>Faults in Line.</h3><p> In looking for a fault in a
bell circuit make sure the battery is working; if
only one or two cells, put the ends of two wires
attached to the terminals on the tongue: a metallic
taste will indicate current.</p>

<p>Then see that the circuit wires are firmly
clamped in the terminals and no dirt or corrosion
on the connections.</p>

<p>Next examine the push button and see that the
wire connections at the springs are perfect.</p>

<p>If there is no movement of the bell at all when
the push is pressed in, take a pocket knife or
screw driver, and touch the blade across the push
springs. If there is current flowing sparks will
be seen when the blade breaks contact between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the springs. If there are no sparks, detach the
wires from the bell and twist the bare ends together.
Then try again for sparks—they may
now be very minute. The tongue test is good here.</p>

<p>If current is detected, examine the bell for the
defects first mentioned.</p>

<p>But if no current is found at the push now the
wires are broken somewhere.</p>

<p>First short circuit the push springs by inserting
a knife blade or piece of wire so as to touch
both of them. Then touch the two wires at the
bell, one to each side wire coming from the magnet
coils. If current is up to the bell and the coils
are all right, a single stroke should result.</p>

<p>Replace the wires in the binding posts, clean
the platinum on both contact screw and armature
spring and try the adjustment. Troubles in the
bell will be mostly similar to those before mentioned.</p>

<p>If no current has been obtained at either bell
or push, and the battery is in good working order,
the line must be tested for a cross or break.</p>

<p>If the wires are touching each other (<a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>)
at some bare spot <i>S</i> between the bell and the battery,
it will be shown by the metallic taste upon
detaching one wire from the battery and laying
it on the tongue <i>T</i>, together with another wire <i>W</i>
from the disconnected terminal of the battery. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
current will travel from the battery to the cross
at <i>S</i>, then back along the second circuit wire to
the tongue and through the short wire to the
battery.</p>

<div id="ip_38" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.9375em;">
  <img id="Fig_35" src="images/i_038.jpg" width="367" height="181" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35</span></div></div>

<p>If no current is obtained in this way it is probable
that the wire is broken.</p>

<div id="ip_38b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.625em;">
  <img id="Fig_36" src="images/i_038b.jpg" width="362" height="156" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36</span></div></div>

<p>The easiest way to find this is to take a bell
to the battery and connect it between the circuit
wires and the battery (<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>).</p>

<p>Then with a sharp knife carefully cut away a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
little piece of the insulation from each wire beyond
the bell and battery and short circuit the bared
spots with the knife blade <i>K</i>. Keep working
towards the push. The bell will ring each time
at <i>K K</i> until the break <i>D</i> is passed, at <i>C</i> it will
not. It becomes an easy matter then to locate
it.</p>

<div id="ip_39" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.5em;">
  <img id="Fig_37" src="images/i_039.jpg" width="360" height="211" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37</span></div></div>

<p>If the bell and push are far apart, as in <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>,
a break between the push and the bell may be
found as shown. With the knife blade <i>K</i> at different
points the bell will ring, but after passing the
break <i>D</i> it will not ring.</p>

<p>Such simple tests as are here given can be carried
out by any one, but far better results will be
obtained if the reason for each is first learned.</p>

<p>This can be readily done by a careful study of
the diagrams and text.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>Alarms</i></span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Fire Alarms.</h3><p> Thermostats, heat alarms and
fire alarms are all practically the same, the term
thermostat being applied principally to the apparatus
which closes the electrical circuit.</p>

<div id="ip_40" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.375em;">
  <img id="Fig_38" src="images/i_040.jpg" width="374" height="180" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38</span></div></div>

<p>Thermostats act on the principle that heat causes
expansion whether of substances, liquids, or gases.</p>

<p>The degree in which different substances expand
varies for the same increase in temperature.
This fact is used in a common form of thermostat
shown in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>. A strip of wood or hard
rubber <i>R</i> has a strip of thin sheet metal <i>S</i> riveted
to it. This compound strip is held at one end by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
a lug <i>L</i> screwed fast to a baseboard. Upon an
increase of temperature the hard rubber expands
more than the metal strip and the compound strip
bends towards the adjustable contact screw <i>A</i>.
Upon touching the latter, the circuit through the
bell <i>B</i>, battery <i>C</i> and the metal strip <i>S</i> is completed,
and the bell rings. A contact screw can
be arranged at the other side of <i>S R</i>, which will
give warning of a decrease in temperature, as the
rubber contracts more than the metal strip.</p>

<div id="ip_41" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.8125em;">
  <img id="Fig_39" src="images/i_041.jpg" width="381" height="190" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39</span></div></div>

<p>In some thermostats of this character two metals
having different coefficients of expansion, such as
steel and brass, are used instead of metal and hard
rubber.</p>

<p>Thermostats of this nature are much used in
incubators, and they can readily be combined with
electric apparatus to open or close hot-air valves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
dampers, etc., and thus regulate the supply of
hot air, hot water, or gas.</p>

<p>A thermostat much used in fire alarm work has
a thin metal chamber which is air tight. An increase
of temperature causes the air to expand,
which swells out the walls of the chamber and
closes an electric circuit.</p>

<div id="ip_42" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.875em;">
  <img id="Fig_40" src="images/i_042.jpg" width="382" height="254" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40</span></div></div>

<p>The mercurial thermostat shown in <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a> has
a glass tube <i>T</i> and bulb containing mercury. Into
each end is sealed a platinum wire <i>P P</i>. Upon
the temperature rising to a predetermined degree,
the expanded mercury completes the circuit between
<i>P P</i> and the battery <i>C</i> and bell <i>B</i> are put
in operation.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a> is the open circuit system most used by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the fire alarm companies, only one circuit of six
thermostats being illustrated.</p>

<p>It will be seen that if any thermostat closes the
circuit between the outer and inner wires of the
ring <i>A B</i>, current will flow through the corresponding
drop of the annunciator and will attract
the armature <i>A</i> of the relay. This will cause the
bell to ring. As the relay is connected to the annunciator
as before shown for the annunciator bell,
it offers a common path for any drop to the battery.
Thus the bell will ring for any circuit, but
the individual drop only will fall. In a simpler
circuit the relay may be dispensed with and a
vibrating bell only used.</p>

<p>Thermostats may be operated on open or closed
circuits, that is, they may give the alarm by closing
a circuit and ringing a bell, or by opening one
and releasing a contact spring as in the burglar
alarm system to be described later.<br /></p>

<h3>Water Level Alarms.</h3><p> Where it is desired to
signal the rising or falling of water in a tank
above or below a given point, a water level indicator
as in <a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a> may be used.</p>

<p>A hollow ball <i>H</i> is mounted on the end of a
rod which slides vertically in guides, not shown.
Adjustable stops <i>S S</i> press against a spring
arm <i>R</i>, pressing it up or down, according as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
water level is rising or falling. If rising, <i>R</i> makes
contact with the adjustable screw <i>A</i>, if falling,
with <i>D</i>, in both cases completing the electrical circuit
of the battery <i>C</i> and bell <i>B</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.6875em;">
  <img id="Fig_41" src="images/i_044.jpg" width="363" height="398" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41</span></div></div>

<p>Another and simpler form is shown in <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>,
where the ball <i>H</i> is mounted on the end of a
lever <i>L</i> pivoted at <i>P</i>, its rise or fall completing
the circuit of <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Where it is desired to give a different signal for
the rise and the fall of level, two bells <i>B</i> and <i>E</i>
(<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>) may be used connected as shown. The
rising of the ball will ring bell <i>B</i>, and its fall,
bell <i>E</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_45" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.875em;">
  <img id="Fig_42" src="images/i_045.jpg" width="382" height="243" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 42</span></p></div></div>

<div id="ip_45b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.875em;">
  <img id="Fig_43" src="images/i_045b.jpg" width="382" height="248" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 43</span></p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
In both forms of indicator, a means must be
provided that an undue rise may not bend the
lever. This may be accomplished by using contact
springs instead of contact screws; it is, however,
then harder to adjust the indicator to fine differences
of level.</p>

<p>In all cases the contacts must be faced with
platinum to prevent corrosion.<br /></p>

<h3>Burglar Alarms.</h3><p> A burglar alarm is a device
for indicating the opening of a door or window,
by the ringing of a bell or operation of an annunciator.
The contact apparatus at the points to be
protected may either open an electrical circuit or
close one, in the latter case being mere modifications
of push buttons. The simplest form is the
latter or open-circuit method.</p>

<p>The spring contact to be inserted in the door
jamb or window frame is so constructed that
while under pressure the contacts are kept apart
and the circuit is open. But when the door or
window is opened, the pressure is released and
a spring forces the contacts together.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a> is an open-circuit window spring fitted
in the window frame so that when the window
is closed the spring lug <i>S</i> is pressed inwards,
breaking contact with the base <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>If the window is raised, the lug flies to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
position shown by the dotted lines, and making
contact with <i>B</i>, completes the circuit through bell
and battery. These springs are fitted in the side
of the window frame in a vertical position and
are entirely concealed when the window is shut.</p>

<div id="ip_47" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.5625em;">
  <img id="Fig_44" src="images/i_047.jpg" width="377" height="168" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44</span></div></div>

<p>In the closed-circuit system the reverse happens.
The pressure of the closed door or window
keeps the contacts together and its opening
enables them to spring apart.</p>

<div id="ip_47b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.5625em;">
  <img id="Fig_45" src="images/i_047b.jpg" width="409" height="144" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45</span></div></div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a> is a diagram of a closed-circuit
burglar alarm, <i>C</i> a cell of gravity battery, <i>R</i> a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
relay, <i>F</i> the fixed contact and <i>M</i> the movable contact
of the spring, <i>S</i> a stud projecting through
the base of the spring and pushed in by the closed
door.</p>

<p>When the door is closed, <i>S</i> being pushed in,
the circuit of <i>C</i>, <i>R</i>, <i>F</i> and <i>M</i> is closed. The
magnets of the relay hold the armature arm <i>A</i>
forward against a hard rubber contact. But when
<i>S</i> is released, the relay circuit is opened, <i>R</i> loses
its power and <i>A</i> flies back, making contact, and
throwing in circuit bell <i>B</i> and battery <i>L</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_48" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.8125em;">
  <img id="Fig_46" src="images/i_048.jpg" width="381" height="334" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
A form of bell and relay combined is shown in
<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>. Here the armature <i>A</i> is held against the
magnets while the circuit through the spring <i>F</i>
and battery <i>G</i> is closed. But on opening this circuit
the armature flies back and makes contact
with an adjustable contact screw <i>S</i> putting in
circuit a local battery <i>C</i>. The bell is now practically
a vibrating bell; on a closed circuit it rings
until the circuit is again closed or the battery runs
down.</p>

<div id="ip_49" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 19.375em;">
  <img id="Fig_47" src="images/i_049.jpg" width="310" height="256" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47</span></div></div>

<p>A different connection of the same scheme is
<a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>, where only one battery is used. This
must be a gravity battery or some other closed-circuit
battery. The circuit can be easily traced
in the figure and needs no special description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Both of the latter schemes are inferior to one
using a separate relay. If the circuit at the spring
were quickly closed again the bell would either
stop ringing, or be so hampered as to ring very
weakly.</p>

<div id="ip_50" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.3125em;">
  <img id="Fig_48" src="images/i_050.jpg" width="389" height="253" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48</span></div></div>

<p>A relay made as in <a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a> has no spring support
to the armature <i>A</i>, which falls down by gravity.
The adjustable contact <i>C</i> is screwed far back,
so that the armature must fall a considerable distance
away from the electromagnets before it
makes contact. This ensures that the armature
will not be attracted and the bell stopped from
ringing by a re-closing of the circuit at the door
or window spring.</p>

<p>A shade spring (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>), is made for either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
open or closed circuits. In operation, the shade is
pulled down and its string or ring hooked on
to <i>H</i>. This draws <i>H</i> up a trifle against a spiral
spring and its lower end makes contact with an
insulated spring <i>S</i> closing the circuit. If the
shade is disturbed, the spiral spring on the lower
part of <i>H</i> is released and it causes a break of
contact with <i>S</i> in the direction of the arrow.</p>

<div id="ip_51" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.5em;">
  <img id="Fig_49" src="images/i_051.jpg" width="392" height="143" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49</span></div></div>

<p>When made for open circuit, <i>S</i> is bent so that
while under tension no contact is made, but release
of tension causes the contact.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a> gives the wiring of two windows and
a door on the closed-circuit system. It will be
seen that the contact springs are all in series,
opening a window or the door will thus break
the circuit.</p>

<p>When setting the alarm at night by connecting
up the batteries, relay and bell, should any one
of these springs be open the relay armature will
not hold, and the bell rings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
In this figure the relay is replaced by an electromagnet
holding up a drop shutter by magnetic
attraction. Upon the circuit opening, this shutter
falls, exposing a number painted on it. At the
same time it hits a spring contact placed below
it and closes the bell and local battery circuit.<br /></p>

<h3>Door Trip Alarm.</h3><p> A swinging contact door
trip can be attached over a door to ring a bell
when the door is opened.</p>

<div id="ip_53" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.4375em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51</span></div></div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a> the door trip is screwed over the
door so that the lowest arm <i>A</i> is struck by the
door. When the door is opened, in the direction
of the arrow, the arm <i>A</i> is thrust forwards, and in
its turn moves the contact arm <i>C</i>, completing the
bell and battery circuit. But when the door is
being closed, <i>A</i> swinging in the reverse direction
does not move <i>C</i> and no alarm is given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Alarms.</h3><p> The Applegate electrical
matting is composed of wooden slats with
springs so arranged that the weight of any person
stepping on it will close a circuit and ring a bell.</p>

<p>It is intended to be put under the ordinary door
mat or under stair and room carpeting.</p>

<p>The Yale lock switch is a Yale lock and switch
combined. Upon any key but the right one being
inserted, a circuit is closed and an alarm bell is
rung.</p>

<h3>The Annunciator.</h3><p> The mechanism of an annunciator
consists of electromagnets which allow
shutters to drop or needles to move on the circuits
being closed. A bell is also rung in most
cases to call attention to the annunciator. The
number of the circuit is marked on the shutter,
or near the needle, either shutter or needle being
replaced by a reset device, which may be mechanical
or electrical.</p>

<p>Annunciator drops are made in a variety of
forms. <a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a> illustrates the principle underlying
nearly all of them.</p>

<p>When current flows through the magnet coils
<i>M</i>, the armature <i>A</i> is attracted, and being pivoted
at <i>P</i>, the lever hook <i>H</i> rises and allows the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
weighted shutter <i>S</i> to fall and display a number
painted on its inside surface.</p>

<div id="ip_56" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.5625em;">

<p>The needle drop in <a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a> is one that has met
with great favor and works as follows: the soft
iron core of the magnet <i>C</i> has a hole drilled
through it, in which turns the shaft <i>S</i>. An arrow
or needle is attached at the front end over the
face of the annunciator. A notched arm <i>B</i> is
fixed on the rear end of the shaft and is held in
a horizontal position by the end of armature <i>A</i>.</p>

<p>When the current flows around <i>C</i>, armature <i>A</i>
turns on its pivot towards the core of <i>C</i>, as in
<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 54</a>, unlocking <i>B</i>, which falls and thereby
partly rotates shaft <i>S</i> and the arrow.</p>

<p>When it is desired to reset the arrow and arm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
a button is pressed upwards, which raises a rod
carrying an arm <i>R</i>. This latter arm in turn
raises <i>B</i> to its former position, the heavy end
of <i>A</i> falls, and its pointed end locks <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>Pendulum, or swinging, signals are used in annunciator
work, where there is a liability that the
ordinary drop shutter would not be reset. They,
however, only give a visible signal for a few seconds,
and are therefore liable to be overlooked.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a> a pivoted arm carrying a soft iron
armature <i>A</i> and a thin plate <i>B</i> having a number
on it is free to swing in front of an electromagnet
<i>M</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
When the current flows in the electromagnet
the armature is attracted, and upon the circuit
being broken at the push, the armature is released
and the arm swings to and fro.</p>

<p>The drops of an annunciator are wired up as
in <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>.</p>

<div id="ip_58" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22.375em;">

<p>One end of each coil is attached to a common
return wire <i>C</i>, the other end going to the push <i>P</i>.
When <i>P</i> is depressed, the circuit of any drop is
through <i>M</i> along <i>C</i> through bell, battery and up
common battery wire <i>W</i> back to other contact
of push <i>P</i>. Depressing any push does not therefore
affect any other drop but the one controlled
by it.</p>

<h3>Wiring up an Annunciator.</h3><p> A diagram of
the connections for an annunciator with a separate
bell is given in <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>. Where the bell is contained
in the case a terminal will be generally
found for connection.</p>

<div id="ip_59" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.9375em;">

<p>The figure shows a wire running from the battery
to one side of each push button. This is the
common return, or battery wire, and saves installing
two wires from each push. It should be
larger, however, than the rest of the wires, generally
about No. 16 B. &amp; S.</p>

<p>All the wires for an annunciator should be run
before connecting up. There are different methods
of sorting out the wires at the annunciator. One
way is to connect the wires (except of course
common or battery return wires) to the drops in
any order. Then an assistant travels from push
to push and presses each button, noting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
room numbers and the order in which they were
visited.</p>

<p>As each drop falls, its number and order is
noted.</p>

<p>Comparing this with the list made by the assistant
will show the correct changes to make.</p>

<div id="ip_60" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25.625em;">
  <img id="Fig_58" src="images/i_060.jpg" width="410" height="283" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58</span></div></div>

<p>For instance, suppose pushes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
were pressed in that order, and drops 3, 4, 5, 1,
2 and 6 fell in that order. Then the wires at
the annunciator would be changed as follows:
From 3 to 1, 4 to 2, 5 to 3, 1 to 4, and 2 to 5;
6 would already be in its right place.</p>

<p>Another way is to commence by twisting together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
say the wires at No. 1 push. Then go to
the annunciator and touch each of the push wires
to No. 1 drop until it falls. Then connect it,
untwist the wires at No. 1, push and connect it
up. Proceed to No. 2 and so on until all the
pushes have been connected in turn.</p>

<p>In some cases it is desired to answer back to
the person calling, or to be able to call any person
from the annunciator.</p>

<p>A circuit like <a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a> answers the purpose of
both annunciator call and return, or fire, call.
This requires two wires from each room to the
annunciator and a common return wire. By tracing
out the circuit it will be seen that when a
room push is pressed, the annunciator needle and
bell indicate. And when one of the pushes near
the annunciator is pressed, the corresponding
room bell rings. The former circuit is from the
push, along the common return wire, through
bell and annunciator back to the push.</p>

<p>The fire call is from push up line to bell through
bell along common return and through battery to
the push.</p>

<p>The Western Electric single-wire system
(<a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>) uses three-point pushes, two batteries
and two return wires. Battery <i>A</i> is for the annunciator
circuit and battery <i>F</i> for the fire, or return,
call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
In each room the top contact and push spring
contact are normally together.</p>

<p>If one of the pushes below the annunciator is
pressed, battery <i>F</i> is thrown in series with the
bell in the room.</p>

<p>But when the room push is pressed its bell is
cut out and the circuit becomes like an ordinary
annunciator circuit.</p>

<h3>Three Wire Return Call System.</h3><p> A three
wire return call annunciator system is shown in
<a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>.</p>

<p>There are two battery wires installed, from
which taps are taken off and led to each room
or push button.</p>

<p>Three way or return call push buttons are
used as shown at points marked <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>In the diagram, the bells are marked <i>A</i>, the
drops in the annunciator <i>D</i>, the annunciator bell
<i>C</i> and the return call buttons in the annunciator
<i>E</i>. The batteries are as shown at <i>F</i>. The heavy
black outline encloses the annunciator mechanism
and connections which are drawn diagrammatically
for the sake of clearness.</p>

<p>Three stations only are shown on the sketch,
but the annunciators which are manufactured by
Edwards and Co., Inc., of New York, are made
in all standard sizes.<br /></p>

<h3>Installing Elevator Annunciators.</h3><p> The installing
of electric bells and annunciators in elevators
does not present any special problems, although
the apparatus used must be selected with a view to
its being suitable to withstand the shocks incident
to elevator service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<div id="ip_65" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.625em;">
  <img id="Fig_60" src="images/i_065.jpg" width="378" height="632" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
In general the wires leading from the push buttons
on the different floors to the bell or annunciator
in the elevator, are flexible and made up
into a cable. One end of this cable is attached to
the underside of the elevator car, the other end
being fixed usually to the elevator wall, at a point
midway between the top and bottom of the shaft.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a> is shown a diagram of the general
circuit used, details of course differing in each
installation.</p>

<p>One point to be taken care of in elevator work
is the attachment of the cables. The continual
movement tends to break the wires at the two ends
if good flexible cable is not used and the installation
done in a workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>Elevator cable is a standard article and may be
procured through any electrical supply store.
That most commonly used consists of the requisite
number of copper conductors each composed of
16 strands No. 30 B. and S. gauge soft and untinned
copper wire. These flexible conductors are
insulated with two reverse wrappings of cotton and
one braid of cotton. The insulated conductors
are cabled together with a steel supporting strand
where extra tensile strength is required, as in the
case of extra long cables. The number of conductors
generally ranges from 3 to 20 inclusive.</p>

<p>The wires leading from the push buttons to the
cable should be preferably rubber covered and
braided. Only where economy at the outset is desired
may ordinary annunciator or office wires be
employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<div id="ip_67" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24.125em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
A connection block carrying binding posts is
used at each point where the cable connects to the
push button wires or to the annunciator. This may
be home-made or purchased ready made, as desired.<br /></p>

<h3>Burglar Alarm Annunciators.</h3><p> Although almost
any annunciator may be used for open circuit
burglar alarm work, they usually do not contain
certain devices which are desirable in burglar alarm
work.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a> is shown a diagram of a burglar alarm
annunciator, the view being schematic of the back
board.</p>

<p>The references are as follows: <i>A</i> is the main
alarm bell situated wherever desired and connected
to the binding posts <i>BB</i>. The battery connection
leading directly to the battery <i>K</i> is marked <i>C</i>
and that leading to the contact spring is marked
<i>D</i>. The cut-off switch <i>E</i> cuts off the battery while
<i>F</i> is the constant ring switch. <i>G</i> is the upper bar
and <i>H</i> the lower bar, while the letters <i>JJ</i> denote
the indicating drops. The door and window springs
are lettered <i>S</i>. At <i>L</i> is a switch which may be
used to disconnect the entire burglar alarm system.
Where it is desired to disconnect only a section
at a time, the switch corresponding to the
section is turned off the upper bar <i>G</i> and on to the
lower bar <i>H</i>.</p>

<h3>Clock Alarm Circuit.</h3><p> A diagram of the wiring
and connections on the back board of all clock
alarms is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>. This diagram
embodies the principles of the last described circuit,
but includes the circuit of a clock-operated alarm.<br /></p>

<h3>Bells for High Voltages.</h3><p> The use of electric
bells on lighting circuits is becoming quite general,
as it obviates the necessity of using batteries, and
thereby simplifies both installation and maintenance.</p>

<p>There is no fundamental objection to operating
make and break bells on electric light circuits. Providing
the voltage and amperage are the same,
there is little difference between the current from
a direct-current dynamo and that from a battery.
But owing to the higher voltages of the lighting circuit
over that generally employed from batteries,
the bell coils must be wound to high resistances to
keep down the current strength. There are also
other slight changes to assist in suppressing sparking,
as have been already treated on.</p>

<p>Where the circuit is not over 220 volts, the bells
are wound with fine wire and have also self-contained
resistance coils. For 500 volts and over, a
resistance lamp is connected in with the bell which
in this case is wound for a 150-volt circuit.</p>

<p>These bells up to 6-inch and inclusive will operate
on circuits of either direct or alternating current.</p>

<p>Above this size it is necessary to use specially
constructed bells on alternating current circuits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<div id="ip_71" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27.0625em;">
  <img id="Fig_63" src="images/i_071.jpg" width="433" height="800" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Most large hotels and office buildings having
direct current lighting service are using it for ringing
bells and similar work to the total exclusion
of batteries.</p>

<p>Where the number of units to be operated justifies
it, motor generators are operated in connection
with the lighting mains to produce a low voltage
most suitable for the bells. The connections in
this case are no different to those when batteries
are employed.<br /></p>

<h3>Bell-ringing Transformers.</h3><p> The best system
for operating bells and annunciators from alternating
current circuits is undoubtedly that employing
small specially constructed transformers to reduce
the voltage. These transformers are being used
universally for hotel and office work where alternating
current is available. They are simple, being
merely one or more coils of well insulated wire
wound on soft iron cores and having connections
for both the lighting circuit and the bell circuit.</p>

<p>As a general rule the coils are divided as to their
number of turns or according to the ratio of transformation
desired. For example, if the circuit
were 110 volts and 10 volts was required for the
bell circuit, the total number of turns in the transformer
would be connected, 10/11 to the lighting circuit
and 1/11 to the bell circuit.</p>

<p>The bell-ringing transformers on the market are
made in several styles. One small style, <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a>,
for single residences, is for use on 110 volts and
produces a bell voltage or secondary voltage as it
is termed, of 6 volts. Another size, <a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>, of this
transformer has three secondary voltages 6, 12 and
18, each of which can be used by connecting to the
right binding posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<div id="ip_73" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 16em;">

<p class="p1">BELL-RINGING TRANSFORMERS.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
It is to be noted that where the lighting service
voltage or primary voltage varies from the above,
the secondary voltage delivered to the bell circuit
will vary in like proportion. It should also be noted
that a careless reversing of the connections, that
is connecting the secondary leads to the lighting
circuits, instead of the primary leads would
cause a like high voltage at the other terminals of
the transformer, raising it in due proportion instead
of lowering it. Thus such carelessness would
produce a voltage of 2,400 volts instead of 6 if a
transformer intended to deliver 6 volts from a 120-volt
circuit was wrongly connected.</p>

<p>The results might very well then be dangerous.
All transformers are properly marked, however,
and such an error only occurs through ignorance or
carelessness.</p>

<p>The installation of these bell-ringing transformers
is simplicity itself; they require no care after installation
and have met with the approval of the
National Board of Fire Underwriters.<br /></p>

<h3>Combination Circuits.</h3><p> Circuits intended primarily
for electric bells or annunciators in houses
and apartments may often be also made to serve
for other electrical devices such as door openers,
house telephones, etc. This subsidiary apparatus
may be installed with a little additional wiring or
perhaps will not need any other wires, as when
both the devices are not used at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<div id="ip_75" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img id="Fig_66" src="images/i_075.jpg" width="800" height="241" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Electrical door openers are great conveniences
and are practically indispensable where the outside
door is on another level to the location of the
dweller or where two or more families occupy the
same house. The device is simple, consisting of an
electrically released spring-plate against which the
lock bolt is normally held and a door opening spring.</p>

<p>When the door opener button is pressed, the
spring plate is released, releasing the lock bolt by
the same action. The door spring then forces the
door open enough to clear the opener plate, which
flies back into position when the button is released.</p>

<p>These door openers are made in several forms
for door frames, such as those on thin doors, iron
gates, for surface or rim locks, for thick doors,
sliding doors and any other regular type of door.</p>

<p>The push button is the same as used for electric
bells and may be located wherever desired. The
pushes are wired in multiple as shown in Figs. 66
and 67, which are two circuits of a type of the
Western Electric interphone, a system of house
telephones supplied for houses and buildings of
every size. <a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a> shows a circuit which provides
telephone service between the vestibule and the
apartments, the door opener wiring being clearly
indicated. In <a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a> the circuit provides a more
extensive service, enabling the janitor, the apartments
and the tradesmen to intercommunicate in
the most desirable system. The door opener wiring
is also clearly shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<div id="ip_77" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 50em;">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
The convenience of having telephone connection
in the house or hotel and its advantages over speaking
tubes are too well known to need extended
comment. Where electric bells have already been
installed it is quite feasible now to use the same
wires for telephones also.</p>

<p>Telephone sets especially designed for this service
are manufactured by the Western Electric Company
in their interphone series. They are simple
and compact, and may be installed by anyone who
can put up an electric bell.<br /></p>

<h3>Fire Alarm Circuits.</h3><p> A fire alarm circuit suitable
for factories, private plants or groups of
buildings is shown in <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>. It is a series system,
with closed circuit, the gongs sounding whenever
the circuit is opened whether by the contact breaker
in the boxes or by the accidental breaking of a wire.
This insures that it remains in good working order,
as when any part of the circuit is opened, a warning
tap is sounded on every bell or gong.</p>

<p>The boxes have contact breakers which send a
separate number of impulses for each box, thus announcing
the box number on each gong. The boxes
and gongs may be located anywhere, as the system
is perfectly flexible.</p>

<p>The reference letters in the diagram are as follows:
<i>C</i> indicates the gongs which are preferably
of the electro-mechanical type, a coiled spring providing
force for the blow, electricity being merely
used to release and retain the hammer or striker.
The alarm boxes are marked <i>BB</i> and the battery
which is of the closed circuit type is marked <i>D</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<h3>Interior Fire Alarm System.</h3><p> Another system
suitable more particularly for indoor operation is
illustrated in <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>. Here the alarm is given by
breaking the glass front of an alarm box and releasing
or pressing an electrical contact.</p>

<p>The box sounded indicates by causing a drop to
fall on an annunciator and at the same time rings
an alarm bell. The latter are generally provided
with constant ring attachments, which keep the
bell sounding until shut off.</p>

<p>The annunciator shown in the diagram has
switches for controlling each individual bell circuit,
and also for control of the entire system.</p>

<p>There is no practical limit to the number of stations
in this system, it being determined by the size
of the annunciator used or by other obvious factors.</p>

<p>The reference letters on the diagram are as follows:
<i>A</i>, alarm bells which may be located wherever
desired. <i>B</i>, break-glass alarm boxes also located
at convenient points. <i>C</i>, annunciator drops,
<i>D</i>, switches on annunciator which control each individual
bell circuit, enabling any circuit to be cut
out, cut in or tested without disturbing any other
circuit. <i>E</i> is a general alarm switch, causing all
bells to ring at once when it is operated.</p>

<p>The battery <i>F</i> varies with the number of bells and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
boxes and the length of line, from three cells upwards.
A cut-out switch <i>H</i> is added to cut out
the entire system by opening the battery wire.
The annunciator bell is at <i>I</i>, an auxiliary bell being
added in multiple with it when necessary.</p>

<h3>Fire Alarm System for Considerable Areas.</h3><p>
Where the area is more extensive and the number
of stations considerable, the system illustrated in
<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a> is very suitable. It consists of the requisite
number of break-glass boxes, bells and a more
elaborate annunciator system. In general details it
resembles the last system, but uses a relay to send
out the current for ringing the alarm bells.</p>

<p>When a box operates, the current impulses sent
on the line act on the relay instead of directly on
the bells. Each stroke of the relay closes a local
circuit which includes the bells and the battery.</p>

<p>This system does away with large batteries and
is very economical of wire. The current needed
for the relay is very small, whereas in a direct system
of any size, the current and voltage to ring a
number of bells located at wide intervals would be
prohibitive.</p>

<p>The reference letters are as follows: <i>AA</i> are
the alarm bells, <i>BB</i> the break-glass alarm boxes,
<i>C</i> is the annunciator bell, <i>D</i> is the relay which remains
closed when an alarm comes in keeping the
bells constantly ringing until shut off. <i>E</i> is a resistance
coil and <i>F</i> is the battery.</p>

<p>A system cut-out switch <i>G</i> and <i>JJ</i> switches on
the annunciator for controlling individual circuits
are also provided. <i>HH</i> are the annunciator drops
and <i>K</i> is a constant-ring switch which can also be
used for a general alarm to ring all the bells at
once.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this, the second edition, the author has
followed his original plan of writing a plain practical handbook on
the manufacture of alcohol and de-naturing for industrial purposes.
This industry is bound to grow to enormous proportions
as it has in Germany where over 100,000,000 gallons were manufactured
last year principally in small farm distilleries. This work
is not intended as a scientific treatise but as a help to farmers
and others wishing to go into this industry on a moderate scale.</p>

<p>The original matter has been carefully revised. Some of the
chapters rewritten and a very considerable amount of new information
added. The total number of illustrations brought up to 60
including a number of plates giving the layout of distilleries.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
